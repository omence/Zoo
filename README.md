# Zoo

What is the purpose of the program?

This is a digital representation of a zoo.  Its demonstrates OOP principles. 

Inheritance, means child classes and inherit properties and mthods of parent classes.

In the project, we are using inheritance by creating relationships between parent and children classes.  This allows the children classes to have access to the properties and methods of the parent class.


polymorphism, means being able to make modifications to inherited properties and methods.

In this project we used Virtual and Abstract to utilize polymorphism.

Abstraction removes the particulars and requires future definition.

Encapsulation, is hiding the innerworking and details from the outside.

The difference between a Class and an object is an object is an instance of a class.

In the project, we are using inheritance by creating relationships between parent and children classes.  This allows the children classes to have access to the properties and methods of the parent class.
